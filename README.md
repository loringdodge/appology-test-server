UpNest Mobile Test Server
==================================
This is the server initially used to test the routes related to the Ionic mobile application.

How to get started?
-------------
In order to get the test server going, type in the following into the command line.
```
$ node server
```
Made sure that you're in the /server folder and that mobile is a sibling folder.
For example:

```
/mobile
/server

```

If it's working correctly, you'll see the following in the command line:

```
Server started with NODE_ENV="undefined" on PORT="8888"
```
